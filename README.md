# Date JS
Vieolo's Custom JS Date class.
`VDate` is an extension of the standard javascript `Date` class.

## Install

```bash
npm install @vieolo/date
```

## Usage
In the target package, the class can be imported as followed
```JS
import VDate from '@vieolo/date';
```

`VDate` is an extension of the native javascript `Date` class. So, the behavior of `VDate` is completely similar to that of native `Date`.

`VDate` gives you the benefit of extra functionalities, both as instance methods and static functions.
